title: Micro Services After Shock
content: >-
  After many companies and organizations adopted the micro-service architecture
  it maybe is time to see how this architecture style has impacted not only the
  software but also other parts of the company and even in the whole industry.




  1. Doing micro-services is very hard!

  2. There seems to be a link between the software architecture style and the
  company structure. The more independent the individual teams are the more
  likely this architectural style will succeed.

  3. Micro-service architecture facilitates the usage of multiple frameworks and
  languages. This empowerment allows teams to select the exact tools for the
  job. Nevertheless, a lot of care must be taken not to overwhelm people and the
  organization to a point of total chaos. Code reuse is not a bad thing.

  4. As micro-services have advocated for smaller unit s of work, this has been
  taken further into different areas such as the micro-frontends and even
  serverless architectures.
