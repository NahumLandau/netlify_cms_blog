title: Remote Working & Distributed Teams
content: >-
  Developers working together, remotely, from all around the world is becoming
  more popular for Software Development using Distributed team style which is
  composed of developers who work remotely from all around the world rather than
  being co-located in a single office. We believe companies all over the world
  will embrace more flexible and remote working styles.




  Here’s why we’ll see the rise of the distributed workforce:




  * It’s never been easier to work remotely, Today, technology connects us
  instantly. Video conferencing allows us to chat practically face-to-face, and
  group messaging tools put us in constant contact, whether our teams are in the
  same city or different time zones.

  * It’s harder than ever to attract and retain talent, distributed teams have a
  distinct advantage—they offer companies the ability to meet talent developers
  where they are.

  * Companies must be agile to survive, A distributed team structure can help
  companies work with more agility. Think about it: If your developers are
  working from locations all around the world, you’ll have people on the clock
  for more of each 24 hours.

  * The workplace is becoming more developers-centric, More people than ever
  want—and expect—flexible work arrangements.
