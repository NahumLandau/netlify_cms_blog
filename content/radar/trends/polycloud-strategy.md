title: Polycloud Strategy
content: >-
  “Polycloud Strategy” is an approach where companies/developers choose the
  right service for tasks, based on features capability, without consideration
  if he in the cloud provider that other services of your application using. The
  concept is choosing the right service for your tasks, across clouds provider.
  for example, your application running on AWS but you are using BigQuery of
  Google for your data analysts. This concept is starting to be adopted because
  the three major cloud providers have more or less the same services and you
  can leverage the difference of specific services that fit your needs.


  This concept is different from cloud-agnostic, You don’t try to create an
  application that, can run on any provider but using the best service that fits
  your needs. When using this “polycloud strategy”, You can find your self
  dealing with data transfer between cloud providers, which can be more
  expensive.
