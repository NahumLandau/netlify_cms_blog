title: AIOps & Data Driven Approach
content: >-
  What is AIOps?




  Put simply, AIOps is the application of machine learning (ML) and data science
  to IT operations problems. AIOps platforms combine big data and ML
  functionality to enhance and partially replace all primary IT operations
  functions, including availability and performance monitoring, event
  correlation and analysis, and IT service management and automation.




  In addition, we see more and more adoption of ML (and eventually some level of
  AI) on the day to day operations, which help build
  self-healing/self-maintained infrastructure, using advanced monitoring and
  tracing capabilities which were commoditized over the past decade and rapidly
  evolved with the popularity of Microservices and Cloud-Native technologies.




  Similarly, we also see a rise in AI-driven operations as part of the SDLC, in
  the form of IDE plugins/extensions & SaaS providing similar insights as part
  of the CI/CD processes.
